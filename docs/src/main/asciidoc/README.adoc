## Microservices Dashboard Server

### Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide a server implementation for the Microservices Dashboard UI project.
This implementation is for now only supporting Spring Boot microservices.
It will query other Spring Boot applications for their actuator endpoints (such as ```/health```) to get information on their status and their dependencies.
After gathering these details from all available applications, it will aggregate these into a single snapshot.
This snapshot can be retrieved by the Microservices Dashboard UI application.
